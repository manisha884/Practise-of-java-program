Here are 50 of the best interview questions to assess culture fit:
1.What gets you excited about coming to work?
ans: working well as part of a team. leading a team to success. completing a difficult project, 
and seeing it through to the end. spotting flaws and errors so as to make sure the end result 
of a project is as good as possible

What gets me excited about going to work is the opportunity I have to help others.I’m motivated 
by my ability to be a positive influence that leads others to find success. I also love the 
creative aspect of what I do and I’ve always said that recruiting is more art than science.

2.What was the last really great book you read?
3.What surprises people about you?
1. I really like to work:-I’m OK with “working all the time” or whatever.
“The only time I’m not happy is when I am not working in some way or another. When I’m just dicking around. To me, that’s unhappiness. Idling. Happiness is working and excelling. Fulfilling your potential.”

2. I’m a fan of cycling
But isn’t that the most boring sport ever? Like, for 5 hours nothing happens, just people going faster and slower and slower and faster and sometimes crashing.
It is kind of monotonous. So why on earth do I like it? My father is a cycling fan too and, ever since I was little, we used to watch it together, meanwhile reading the newspaper, swapping parts we had each finished, talking about the race and the news. Reading something while watching cycling reminds me of that and that makes me feel good.
Other non-work things I enjoy: craft beer (especially stouts), talking with friends/family, walking, ASMR — anyone? — , neat-but-not-too-fancy shirts, wearing a cap so that I don’t have to do my hair, discovering new food, places, and states of mind, cabaret, signing out loud, forests.
3. I often wonder whether I’d do anything “hard” if I could just feel good all day
Except when I’m hungover, I have a hard time “just” being happy. Does living well require some struggle or goal-achievement, or is that just me?
To an article that asked how there can be truths about how to live in the first place, a friend replied:
“It seems you need the answer to your questions to measure up against ‘am I living my life okay?’ Or ‘am I okay?’”
This hurts.
On the one hand, I tend to think that improving yourself to make a difference is something people who were born in a privileged position like mine should do. On the other hand, I sometimes envy people who seem to be less bothered by this alleged burden, leading me to doubt whether I’m instead working so hard to satisfy my need to believe that I’m okay.
4. I never know the way
I don’t have any sense of direction whatsoever. Some years ago, for example, I was on holiday with some friends and while we apparently could already see our hostel, I still managed to lead us astray. When I take an IQ-test, I always get all the questions measuring spatial intelligence wrong. Like I should have learned some skill that I never learned.
5. I don’t have any social intelligence either
Back when I turned 21, with that same group of friends, we had this thing going where we would ‘roast’ each other on our birthdays. Among other things, I apparently “have the social skills of a solitary suicide bomber”. For some reason, I don’t ‘get’ a lot of this empathy stuff and social rules and reading between the lines and knowing how to understand how others feel. It feels like there’s something ‘missing’ in me. Again, like I should have learned some skill that I never learned. But I’m happy to report that I have been told that I’m making huge progress on this. 💪
6. One of my favorite things is experiencing a different culture
One month after I turned 18, I lived in Cambodia for a couple of months to teach English there. I have since fallen in love with seeing the world from a different perspective. In 2016–17 I lived in Africa for almost six months. I also did two months of Couchsurfing — you want to meet the locals! — in Eastern Europe. Comprehending life from diverse perspectives makes you realize that your own default framework is not ‘standard’, but optional.
Sadly, Hungarian wages don’t quite allow me to go on a big trip soon.
7. When I grow up I want to…?
As Seth Godin writes, “the idea of thinking about “when I grow up” is mostly an ill-formed fantasy”.
You know, when I think about my future, nothing gives me a ‘this is it’ feeling. There is not one thing I’d like to do, but many. I want to be a writer, I want to be a teacher, I want to make a large-scale difference in education.
I don’t have a dream job.
But, having a family is a top priority for me.
8. I’m fond of playing around with my state of consciousness
Because being ‘me’ all the time gets boring.
To literally, deeply experience life in a different way, I believe, chemical means are the most effective ones. I thoroughly enjoy these episodes and get a lot of meaning out of them.
9. I never set an alarm, unless I really have to
Oh, the joys of being a PhD candidate and not having a 9-to-5 job! I usually go to bed between midnight and 1, and wake up around 9 or so.
10. I’m currently working on…
Next academic year is going to be packed! In addition to everything I’m always working on (my PhD in philosophy and writing one quality essay per week) I have two big projects for this year:
